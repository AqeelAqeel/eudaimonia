    <h1>SITE UNDER CONSTRUCTION WHILE WE'RE COORDINATING</h1>
    <h1>Eudaimonia</h1>
    <p>Where human flourishing meets frontier tech. We're building an offline community to help ambitious and value aligned people build their life's work in San Francisco.</p>

    <h2>Today, our community:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 coliving homes & apartments</li>
        <li>A shared home gym</li>
        <li>Cowork in a private office for AI startups and tinkerers</li>
        <li><a href="https://tinyurl.com/yuct68e3">A directory to help you find housing in SF</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>We're home to builders, creatives, researchers, and founders of early stage startups</h2>

    
    <h2>Our Overarching Philosophy</h2>
    <p>At Eudaimonia, we believe in constructing and designing your own life with full-stack integration of all your parts. It's about leveraging and building systems to achieve your desires, purpose, and more. Think of it as 'ikigai' taken to the next level, where we aim for higher lows, not just higher highs.</p>
    <p>We blend "Extreme ownership" with mindfulness, fostering a bias towards action. We're not just about self-improvement; we're about nurturing all areas of life and actively building and testing ideas. Welcome to a community dedicated to building strong systems for a higher baseline in life.</p>

    <h2>While, we're affiliated with a number of renown companies and names in the world of tech, ai, and investing... that doesn't truly matter to us. </h2>
        
    <p>What's more important is being affiliated with individuals that are self aware, upstanding humans, that are fully present and at peace in the pursuit of their well rounded life areas and aspirations.  </p>
